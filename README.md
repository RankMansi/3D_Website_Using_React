# 3D Website using Three.js and React

This project is a demonstration of integrating Three.js, a powerful 3D library, with React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. By combining these technologies, we can create immersive 3D experiences within web applications.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**

2. **Install dependencies** 

3. **Run the development server** 

4. **Open the application**
Once the development server is running, open your browser and navigate to your localhost server to view the website.

## Features

- **Three.js Integration**: Utilizes the powerful Three.js library for creating and rendering 3D scenes directly within the browser.
- **React Component Structure**: Organizes the application's components using React, allowing for a modular and reusable codebase.
- **Customizable**: Easily customize and extend the 3D scenes and components to fit your specific requirements.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures the website is responsive and works seamlessly across various devices and screen sizes.
